# Revival

## t]m 18–19 typeface revival project

A digitisation and revival of Weiß Antiqua from a 1957 book printed in cold metal at the Bauer Type Foundry in Frankfurt am Main.

This project is part of my masters study at KABK in Den Haag. While public comments, issues and pull requests are welcome, I will probably ignore them. I'm making this git repo public for others to use as a reference or for insight into my process, rather than to ask for feedback.

The copyright status of this project is not fully established. Since the rights to other digitisations of Weiß Antiqua are still held by multiple entities, I cannot comment on whether it would be permissible to generate a font from the files contained here.
